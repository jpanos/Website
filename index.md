# ECE 477 Sowin' Seeds

## Sub head testing

This is an example landing page for our website 2.0 step one is going to be adding on new pages to the site to increase the ability to navigate our site.

## Project Description

Sowin' Seeds is developing a pollination drone. This project is inspired by the premise that global pollinator populations are decreasing at an alarming rate, and this could wreak havoc on the agricultural industry and the global food supply. This pollination drone aims to cross pollinate crops with minimal human input. For the scope of our inital prototype, our drone will target apple blossoms, but could be extended beyond one species in the future. Not only could our product be used in fields and orchards it could also be used in, for example, greenhouses, urban gardens, and other applications where pollinators are not easily available. The drone will be equipped with a Jetson Nano to perform most of the image processing tasks, and STM32H7 to make important flight decisions and process positional data, among other control operations, and a PixHawk flight controller for the drone.

## Planned improvments

  - Creating a functional final PCB mount so that we can limit the need for development boards on our drone.
  - Improve algorithm for flower detection so that it can work with an expanded range of colors and shapes. 
  - TBD
